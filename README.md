# React Library with MongoDB

[Live Deploy](https://react-library-exercise.herokuapp.com/)

# Description
This project was an in-class activity for a Full-Stack Bootcamp to get practice working with React states and MongoDB at the same time.

# Functionality

On the load, the page will load books on the right hand side (if any are available). The form on the left will allow you to add a book (to the db) and displaty it on the right hand side. You can also delete Books (from the DB) and the state should update upon delete.
